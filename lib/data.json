          "description": "\"Flutter by\" began just as its name implies ... with the sharing of little flutters of thought among co-workers and friends. The messages fluttered into their lives quietly and with serenity ... much like the Monarch butterfly -- a personal favorite of mine. My daily messages include a prayer and oftentimes a short story or quotation to show how that reflection applies to our lives and to our humanness. They revolve around the people, places, and particulars in my world -- which are pretty much the same as those in yours. My prayer is that this book helps you through each day with a flutter of thought, a breath of calmness, and a reflection for peace, love, and endurance. I pray that these little thoughts help you smile and see the true beauty of God's touch in each day -- even in those filled with sorrow. For, as we flutter by, we flutter on. Through Flutter by, you'll meet my husband Howard (often referred to as Ole Buckeye ... Ohio State is his alma mater.); our daughters Diane and Lori; and, of course, Chaplain Ditrick the Third (our Shetland sheepdog). Most times, \"Chap\" concludes my prayerful thoughts with a flutter of his own. They usually involve \"treats.\" As a hospital chaplain, I got to know and become close to many of the staff, especially the nurses. One friend in particular was going through a very difficult time in her personal life. She faced continuous challenges and difficult decisions. Often, she confided that she didn't know how or even if she would get through it all. Each time that we talked, I came away feeling that I wanted to be so much more than someone who listened. I wanted to do something to ease her pain. I asked God to guide me to an answer to calm her burden. On one particularly busy day, I knew that our paths would not cross, but I wanted my friend to know that I was thinking about and praying for her. I wrote her a quick little prayer and sent it off through the inner-office mail. (This was before computers!) A few days, later, I sent another prayer ... then another ... and another. When we met up several days later, she thanked me again and again. She told me how much those little prayers meant to her and how she looked forward to receiving them. She asked if she could share them with friends at the hospital. I was touched and said of course! From there, the \"prayer\" mailing list grew to over 300 co-workers and friends. (Thank goodness computers came along!) May you flutter by others as you have fluttered by me.",

She is determined to find out how she ended up there & why, but when the only person who can help her, continuously lies to her, she finds herself forced to suffer alone. She can't ignore the strange things that begin to happen to her nor can she hide from the nightmares that haunt her sleep. And when her world collides with Adan - the mysterious boy whom she can't seem to stay away from, literally - she is consumed by the flutter that sparks whenever he is around and she is desperate to discover the reason why. AdanAdan's mission to find Sara has finally begun - It seemed simple: bring her back to the enchanted world that lives, breathes and survives because of her, but he quickly finds himself faced with an entirely new challenge. Immediately, Adan realizes that staying unknown to Sara is a task he will fail before he even begins; the pull to her is far too strong to refuse, but being with her will defy the very reason he existed. He is the key to her survival and being with her is not part of the path that he was born to follow. Can he find it in himself too resist the urge to be with or will he destroy everything that had been left to Sara to protect and defend.FlutterAs Sara and Adan struggle to overcome their own separate battles - There is a far more determined evil that is stalking the shadows and waiting to annihilate them both. Together they will fight to change the rules and rewrite their fate.",

With his new found friend Katie the bee ( Bee-Longing's adorable bee), they learn life lessons and sing songs while teaching others to do the same. Together they enjoy life a little more each day. This whimsical story teaches children how to make life a little sweeter. While showing that it's good to make friends that are different and mistakes are a part of growing, so get out there and get messy. This is an excellent sequel to the whimsical tale of Bee-Longing, who knows where these characters will end up.",

Throughout the years, books of poetry have been literary companions that have deepened my appreciation for life. I value the poem as a truly unique art form. The immense power of its words seeks truth and values intimacy. The poem is a vehicle of meaning that shapes illusive thoughts and feelings in to a beautiful melody of form and content. For me, poetry is a large part of who I am and how I see the world. It is my hope that you will enjoy this book of poetry as my particular attempt to sculpt thoughts and feelings into poetic form.",
